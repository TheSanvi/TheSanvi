About Me:
Hi, Iâ€™m Sanvi Verma

I build Android and Flutter apps, and Iâ€™ve recently been diving deeper into AI/ML, neural networks, and generative AI.
My main goal is simple: take AI out of research papers and bring it into everyday mobile apps that actually solve problems.

What I Do

I design and build mobile apps that not only look clean but also have clean, maintainable code behind them.

Iâ€™ve worked with Flutter & Android (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose) for several years, shipping both hobby projects and production-ready apps.

Iâ€™ve integrated OpenAI models into apps (because why should mobile apps just sit there when they can think?).

Iâ€™m now learning and experimenting with deep learning, generative AI, and agentic AI frameworks, exploring ways to merge them seamlessly with mobile.
