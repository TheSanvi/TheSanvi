#  About Me:
Hi, I’m Sanvi Verma<br><br>I build Android and Flutter apps, and I’ve recently been diving deeper into AI/ML, neural networks, and generative AI.<br>My main goal is simple: take AI out of research papers and bring it into everyday mobile apps that actually solve problems.<br><br>What I Do<br><br>I design and build mobile apps that not only look clean but also have clean, maintainable code behind them.<br><br>I’ve worked with Flutter & Android (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose) for several years, shipping both hobby projects and production-ready apps.<br><br>I’ve integrated OpenAI models into apps (because why should mobile apps just sit there when they can think?).<br><br>I’m now learning and experimenting with deep learning, generative AI, and agentic AI frameworks, exploring ways to merge them seamlessly with mobile.
